# etch-a-sketch

This project will produce a functioning application where users will be able to create a drawing space, and draw on it when their mouse hovers over it. Users will be able to clear the grid and make a new grid of their own definition. 

In this project, I hope to learn how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.
